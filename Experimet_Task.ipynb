In order to ensure a safe and efficient flight, pilots must follow strict protocols and regulations. They can work for private companies, government agencies, or commercial airlines. Their role can vary depending on the employer and the type of aircraft they operate. While commercial airline pilots work in teams and fly long distances, private pilots tend to operate smaller aircraft and have more flexible schedules.\n",
